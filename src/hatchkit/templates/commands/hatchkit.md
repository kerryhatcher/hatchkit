# hatchkit AI Development Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all Claude Code interactions in this project.

## Principles

- Make the **smallest** change that satisfies the requirement
- Always run existing tests before and after changes
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever optimisations
- Document non-obvious decisions with brief comments

## Workflow

1. Understand the requirement fully before writing any code
2. Identify the minimal set of files to change
3. Write or update tests first when adding new behaviour
4. Verify with linting and tests
5. Summarise what changed and why
