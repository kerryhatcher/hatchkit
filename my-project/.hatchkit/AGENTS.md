# hatchkit – AI Agent Guidelines

This project uses **hatchkit** for AI-driven development.

## Development Principles

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Prefer small, focused functions and modules
- Always add or update tests when changing behaviour
- Keep dependencies minimal

## Workflow

1. Discuss the requirement and agree on an approach
2. Implement the smallest change that satisfies the requirement
3. Verify with tests and linting before marking work complete
